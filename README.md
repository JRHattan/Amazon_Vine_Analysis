# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
 
Purpose:

The analysis introduced us to Big Data and AWS, as well as determine whether being a vine member would influence the people's ratings, specifically for 5 star reviews. 

Results:

there were a total of 90 vine reviews and 37831 non-Amazon views, 44 of the vines and 14704 of the non-amazon were 5 star, as analysis.png shows. This puts amazon vine reviews as roughly 10% higher than non amazon vine reviews. (roughly 48% vs roughly 38%).

Summary:

In conclusion, it's hard to concretely say if Vine members are truly scewed, as there are significantly fewer people in it than not. There does appear to be a bias towards positive reviews, however, as there's roughly ten percent more. It could be that people that enjoy reveiew writing are more likely to join vine, as someone indifferent to most products would not care. It would be easier to determine if we also took a look at one star reviews, as it's possible Vine members are simply more opinionated. However, Amazon may benefit from people being more positive and giving good initial reviews to entice more sales, and actively seek people already giving favorable reviews to sell more products.
